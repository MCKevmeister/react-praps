## React 

# useEffect() hook

Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

The purpose of this hook is to run the defined function after rendering or when a certain action occurs.

It adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes, but unified into a single API.
